        "# Task 2: Shopping Basket Recommendation\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reference / Dataset:** Groceries dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heeraldedhia/groceries-dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "**Goal:** Given a shopping basket (e.g. \"pasta\" and \"olive oil\"), recommend additional items that customers often buy together (e.g. \"canned tomato\").\n",
        "\n",
        "**Approach:**\n",
        "- Load real shopping transaction data (who bought what, and when)\n",
        "- Group purchases into baskets (same customer, same date = one basket)\n",
        "- Count how often each pair of items appears in the same basket (co-occurrence)\n",
        "- Reuse Task 1's decision tree model to categorize items and optionally boost recommendations by category\n",
        "- Build a function that scores candidate items by how often they appear with the current basket, then return the top N\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this approach?** I wanted something simple and interpretable. The idea is that if many people buy X and Y together, then when someone has X in their basket, suggesting Y is reasonable. I'm not building a complex model from scratch here; I'm reusing Task 1's categorization as an extra signal (same-category items get a small score boost) and relying mainly on co-occurrence counts. The downside is that very popular items like \"whole milk\" show up a lot because they appear with almost everything, but the logic is easy to explain and the outcome of Task 1 is directly useful here.\n"

So I need to count, for every pair of items (A, B), how many baskets contain both A and B. That number is the co-occurrence count.

At the end we have a dictionary mapping item pairs to counts, plus overall item frequencies. We print the total number of pairs, the most frequent items, and the most frequent pairs so we can see that the data looks sensible (e.g. \"whole milk\" and \"other vegetables\" often together).\n",

        "\n",
        "**Why a single function?** I want one place that takes a basket (list of item names), the cooccurrence and item-count structures we built, and optional Task 1 model/encoder, and returns the top N recommended items with scores. That way we can call it from the test cell and from the \"more examples\" cell with different baskets and parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:** (1) Normalise the basket (lowercase, strip). (2) Initialise a score for each candidate item at 0. For each item in the basket, scan all co-occurrence pairs; if the pair contains that basket item, the other item in the pair is a candidate add the pair's count to that candidate's score. Don't add items already in the basket. (3) If Task 1's model and encoder are loaded, we get the predicted category for each basket item and for each candidate; if a candidate's category is in the basket's categories, we multiply its score by 1.1 (small boost). (4) Sort candidates by score descending and return the top N. So the core logic is \"score = sum of co-occurrence counts with basket items,\" with an optional category boost.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this approach?** It's transparent and easy to debug: we're not fitting a new model here, we're reusing Task 1's output and the co-occurrence counts. The downside is that very popular items (e.g. whole milk) get high scores for almost any basket because they co-occur with everything; that's a known limitation we discuss in the Summary.\n"

        "- This might seem unrelated, but it reflects true shopping behaviour. People buying daily staples often also grab vegetables. \n",
        "- \"rolls/buns\" and \"yogurt\" also appear because these items frequently co occur in general grocery trips.  \n",
        "- The model is not really guessing recipes. It is detecting high frequency co purchases across many shoppers.\n",

        "**Basket: \"chicken\" + \"vegetables\"**  \n",
        "**Top recommendation: \"whole milk\" (score: 51)**  \n",
        "- This is not a cooking related connection, but a basket correlation. Families who buy proteins and fresh produce also tend to buy milk in the same trip.  \n",
        "- \"rolls/buns\", \"soda\", and \"other vegetables\" appear because they are commonly added side items in larger shopping baskets.  \n",
        "- The model finds patterns, not meaning. It is about what people actually buy together.\n",

        "  \n",
        "**Basket: \"yogurt\" + \"berries\"**  \n",
        "**Top recommendation: \"whole milk\" (score: 221)**  \n",
        "- Even though yogurt and berries feel like a breakfast combo, milk is recommended because these three items often appear together in health conscious or breakfast oriented baskets.  \n",
        "- \"other vegetables\" and \"rolls/buns\" show up because consumers buying fresh items often add more staple foods to their baskets.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Why Some Recommendations Might Be Wrong**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rare combinations:**\n",
        "- If \"pasta\" + \"olive oil\" + \"canned tomato\" rarely appear together, it won't be recommended\n",
        "- The system only recommends what it has seen in the data by probability\n",
        "\n",
        "**Too common items:**\n",
        "- Very popular items (like \"whole milk\") appear with everything\n",
        "- They might get recommended even when not relevant\n",
        "- Solution: Filter out items that appear in too many baskets\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations of Our Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **1. Popularity Bias**\n",
        "- **Common items dominate:** Items that appear in many baskets get recommended often\n",
        "  - **Impact:** Less popular but relevant items might be missed\n",
        "- **Example:** \"whole milk\" might be recommended for everything because it's very common\n",
        "- **Solution:** Once in a while, suggest a less popular but related item. Like Spotify, It plays songs people love but sneaks in new artists so people don’t get stuck hearing the same hit song forever\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2. Task 1 Integration**\n",
        "- **Categorization accuracy:** Task 1's model has around 20% accuracy\n",
        "  - **Impact:** Category-based recommendations might be wrong\n",
        "- **Limited categories:** Only 15 categories might not capture all relationships\n",
        "  - **Impact:** Some item relationships might be missed\n",
        "\n",
        "### What This Tells Us\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Good:**\n",
        "- Simple approach that's easy to understand\n",
        "- Based on real customer behavior\n",
        "- Can find patterns in shopping data\n",
        "- Works better with more data\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Problems:**\n",
        "- Simple counting doesn't capture complex relationships\n",
        "- Popular items dominate recommendations\n",
        "- Task 1's categorization helps but has limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "Our recommendation system works by finding items that commonly appear together in shopping baskets. It's simple and transparent, but has limitations due to the simplicity of the approach.\n"
